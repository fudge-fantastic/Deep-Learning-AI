### ASL Detection

---

Building a project: American Sign Language (ASL) detection. This project aims to recognize sign language gestures using hand movements with the help of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It's still under development, thrilled to share the initial progress.

Thanks to Kaggle's amazing P100 GPUs, the model has achieved an impressive accuracy of 91% so far! (Remember, accuracy can vary depending on the situation.) What truly excites me is the model's potential. With the right training data, it could be adapted to recognize gestures in other sign languages too!

This is just the beginning, though. The next steps involve deploying the model to the real world and putting it through rigorous testing. I'm also planning to fine-tune the model for even better performance in the future. Additionally, while I haven't implemented OpenCV yet, it's definitely a tool I'm considering to enable real-time sign language gesture recognition. Stay tuned for exciting updates!
