Hello and welcome. I'm Aaditya, and I've been working on a computer vision project called 'American Sign Language Detection.' This computer vision program assists in recognizing sign language gestures using hand movements. The project is an ongoing work in progress.

The model was trained with the assistance of Kaggle and its GPU P100, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 99%. However, there is more work ahead. Now that we have our model, the next steps involve deploying and testing it using OpenCV.
