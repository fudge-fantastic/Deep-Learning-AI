Hello and welcome. I'm Aaditya, and I've been involved in a computer vision project known as 'American Sign Language Detection.' This project is centered around computer vision and aims to recognize sign language gestures through hand movements. Please note that this project is still a work in progress.

The model was trained with the invaluable assistance of Kaggle and its powerful GPU P100, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 91% (though results may vary). What's particularly exciting about this project is its versatility; it can be adapted to train the model for any sign language provided there's an appropriately labeled dataset for training. Nonetheless, there's more work ahead. Now that the model is in place, our next steps involve deployment and rigorous testing.
